@adammshankman Hey Adam, you can't be permanent judge... then you'd never be able to choreograph  #sytycd
@adammshankman I don't know how follow Friday works either 
@adammshankman Love you on SYTYCD. Your choreography is great. Hope your broken heart is healing.   Much love from Jacksonville, FL.

@adampiro   they said &quot;HR users needed the privacy&quot;. We said &quot;get access to our stuff and you have access to HR anyway&quot;.  We didn't win 
@adampiro sounds that way, although ipods aren't allowed for us either    working for a German organisation, everything is quite strict!
@adampiro we went to duals &quot;as compensation&quot; for having to sit out in the open area with all the other folks. No IT hidey-hole for us

@ArsenalSarah I'll be out there tomorrow! Catching up on indoor stuff today! 
@alvarlux @feedabah note that he has the Korg MicroKorg, same synth I've used for ages   And Roland Fantom-X6. Neither are plugged in.

@alwayswatching How do I get the $100 price cut?

@BTCare Hi there. It seems you have disconnected my broadband line but when I called BT Tech Support was unclear on why 
@BTCare Sent u DM, seems to be problem with modem. Had wireless been ordered correctly would have been fine, gotta wait till Tuesday 
@BTCare Thanks, but spent most of the day on the phone to BT, engineer didn't turn up to activate line and the redirect order got lost. 
@BTCare you could try,where do I start? Router keeps going to factory settings and DSL is managing 1.5mbit/s max on a 2km line length 
@AnaLovebug yes I'm alive... I has lost my life to precal, 8 hours a day = 40 hours a week. That makes anyone go crazy

@AnansiER I'm 30 years old. If I haven't found it by now, I think it's just about too late. 
@Anant they don't have any unlimited plan for GPRS, they charge 30ps/50kb which is expensive for me 
@anant24121986 it is so unfair that all the good rock shows happen only in B'lore and Pune 
@ananyah part of moving house, my line got disconnected today!  I'm using my phone bluetoothed to my laptop!

@buzzbishop why? Green not your colour? Seems a trivial reason to unfollow considering the reason for the green. 
@BuzzEdition May I second that sentiment?  Every so often I see that someone has entered the contest...and get my hopes up...but alas, NO

@Aqueya i found out in talking to Rogers that when i transfer i would lose my phone number, so i've decided to pass on the whole idea 
@AQuietMadness   my back hurts sometimes. I blame that on the computer lol.
@AQuietMadness  I know you dont wanna deal with your sister but maybe you should think about going home.
