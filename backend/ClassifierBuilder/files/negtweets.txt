@adampiro sounds that way, although ipods aren't allowed for us either    working for a German organisation, everything is quite strict!
@adampiro we went to duals &quot;as compensation&quot; for having to sit out in the open area with all the other folks. No IT hidey-hole for us

@ArsenalSarah I'll be out there tomorrow! Catching up on indoor stuff today! 
@alvarlux @feedabah note that he has the Korg MicroKorg, same synth I've used for ages   And Roland Fantom-X6. Neither are plugged in.
@alvarlux it was so freaking hot in the bakery today   I melted
@AlvinYeh I have the now defunct iPhone 3G  I can type pretty quickly though - just learn to trust the autocorrect! What're you up to now?

@alwayswatching How do I get the $100 price cut?

@BTCare Hi there. It seems you have disconnected my broadband line but when I called BT Tech Support was unclear on why 
@BTCare Sent u DM, seems to be problem with modem. Had wireless been ordered correctly would have been fine, gotta wait till Tuesday 
@BTCare Thanks, but spent most of the day on the phone to BT, engineer didn't turn up to activate line and the redirect order got lost. 
@BTCare you could try,where do I start? Router keeps going to factory settings and DSL is managing 1.5mbit/s max on a 2km line length 
@AnaLovebug yes I'm alive... I has lost my life to precal, 8 hours a day = 40 hours a week. That makes anyone go crazy

@buzz Yuck. That sucks.  I'm only speaking from second hand knowledge. Maybe they tied things down. 
@buzzbishop why? Green not your colour? Seems a trivial reason to unfollow considering the reason for the green. 
@BuzzEdition May I second that sentiment?  Every so often I see that someone has entered the contest...and get my hopes up...but alas, NO
