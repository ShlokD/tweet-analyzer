Both boys were still sleeping when it was time for me to go to work. Sure, it's nice, but I kind of miss the 5:30 bonding time... 
Both DH and I are not feeling well. I've got headache from contacts and he's generally yucky.  Good thing no crazy Father's Day plans.
Both Hanoi &amp; Saigon are on the list of 20 hardest Hardship Posts in the world by BusinessWeek  http://ow.ly/50C2 (via @twitvietnam)

Both kids already have more hair than I do so at least they have that working for them until Tyler hits his late 20's.  
Both kids low grade fever.     hope it's nothing.
Both kids spending the night away from home. Wow! A whole evening alone with my sweetie. 
Both my grandparents on my fathers side passed today. At least they went together 
Both my necklace and bracelet broke last night
